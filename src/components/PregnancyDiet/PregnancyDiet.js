             Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for the neurological and early visual development of your baby and for making breast milk after birth. Aim for two weekly servings of cold water fish such as salmon, tuna, sardines, herring, or anchovies. Sardines are widely considered the safest and most sustainable fish to eat, while seaweed is a rich vegetarian source of Omega-3s.

             <li>
             Abstain from alcohol. No amount is safe for the baby.

             Cut down on caffeine, which has been linked to a higher risk of miscarriage and can interfere with iron absorption.
             </li>
             <li>
             Eat smaller, more frequent meals rather than a few large ones. This will help prevent and reduce morning sickness and heartburn.
             </li>

             Be cautious about foods that may be harmful to pregnant women. These include soft cheeses, sushi, deli meats, raw sprouts, and fish such as albacore tuna, swordfish, tilefish, and king mackerel that contain high levels of mercury.

             High-quality protein is also important to your baby's developing brain and nervous system. Opt for high-quality protein from fish, poultry, dairy, and plant-based protein sources rather than relying on just red meat.

             Breastfeeding diet tips
Keep your caloric consumption a little higher to help your body maintain a steady milk supply.
             </li>
             <li>
             Emphasize healthy sources of protein and calcium, which are higher in demand during lactation. Nursing women need about 20 grams more high-quality protein a day than they did before pregnancy to support milk production.
             </li>
             <li>
             Take prenatal vitamin supplements, which are still helpful during breastfeeding, unless your physician tells you otherwise.
             </li>
             <li>

Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine. Just as with the pregnancy guidelines above, refrain from drinking and smoking, and reduce your caffeine intake.

             </li>

             If your baby develops an allergic reaction, you may need to adjust your diet. Common food allergens include cow's milk, eggs, wheat, fish, and citrus. For a cow's milk allergy, you can meet your calcium needs through other high calcium foods, such as kale, broccoli, or sardines.
